### Design System Architecture
The application features a sophisticated design system migrated from BreedBook Pro React codebase:
- **BreedBook Pro Design System**: Complete migration of beautiful HSL color scheme with gradients
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Extensive theming via CSS variables in `globals.css` with BreedBook Pro colors
- **Gradient System**: `bg-gradient-brand`, `bg-gradient-subtle` for modern visual appeal
- **Shadow System**: `shadow-card`, `shadow-elevated` for depth and elevation effects
- **Hover Effects**: Consistent hover animations and state transitions
- **Radix UI Foundation**: All UI components built on Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.17**: Utility-first styling with BreedBook Pro design tokens
- **Chart Integration**: Recharts for data visualization with custom theming
- **PostCSS CommonJS**: Configuration uses CommonJS exports for compatibility

### Key Technical Patterns

#### Client Component Requirements
Components using React hooks must include `"use client"` directive:
- All components in `components/breeder/`, `components/shared/`, etc.
- Toast system (`hooks/use-toast.ts`, `components/ui/toaster.tsx`)
- Mobile detection (`hooks/use-mobile.ts`)

#### Design System Classes
- **Cards**: Use `hover-elevate` class for consistent hover animations
- **Colors**: Chart colors (`chart-1` through `chart-4`) for data visualization
- **Status Indicators**: Role-specific color schemes in `tailwind.config.ts`

#### Navigation Architecture
The application uses AppSidebar component with BreedBook Pro styling for the breeder role:

**Sidebar Configuration:**
- **Width**: 16rem (256px) for expanded state, 3.8rem (60.8px) for collapsed
- **Logo**: Animalytics brand logo with smart collapse behavior
- **Logo Collapse**: Scales 9x and repositions to show just the "A" letter as icon
- **Background**: `bg-surface` with `shadow-card` for depth
- **Active States**: `bg-gradient-brand text-white shadow-card` for current page
- **Hover States**: `text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground hover:bg-accent`

**Navigation Structure:**
- **Main Navigation**: Dashboard, My Animals, Mating Calculator, Reports, Tasks, Marketplace
- **Secondary Navigation**: Breeders, Documents, Settings (separated with border)
- **Group Labels**: Uppercase, tracked spacing with `text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground`
- **Collapsible**: Full Radix UI sidebar with icon mode and smooth transitions

**Navigation Links:**
- Dashboard → `/dashboard`
- My Animals → `/animals`
- Mating Calculator → `/calculators`
- Reports → `/reports` (formerly "Activity Reports" → `/activities`)
- Tasks → `/tasks`
- Marketplace → `/marketplace`
- Breeders → `/breeders`
- Documents → `/documents`
- Settings → `/settings`

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Client-Side Routing**: All navigation uses Next.js Link components for SPA behavior
- **No Page Refreshes**: Proper Next.js client-side navigation prevents PHP-like page reloads
- **Responsive**: Automatically collapses on tablet/mobile devices
- **Logo Animation**: `transition-all duration-200` for smooth collapse/expand

## Backend Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Authentication & User Management (IN PROGRESS 🔄)

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Better Auth Multi-Role System (COMPLETE)
**Implementation Date**: January 2025

**Key Components:**
- ✅ Database schema with Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (Neon)
- ✅ Better Auth configuration with email/password authentication
- ✅ Multi-role support (breeder, veterinarian, admin, event_organizer)
- ✅ Server-side authentication utilities (no insecure middleware)
- ✅ Client-side hooks (useAuth, useRole, useSubscription)
- ✅ Session management (7-day expiration, 1-day refresh)
- ✅ Database migrations applied successfully

**Files Created:**
```
lib/
├── auth/
│   ├── config.ts           # Better Auth server config
│   ├── client.ts           # Client hooks
│   └── server.ts           # Server utilities (requireAuth, requireRole)
├── db/
│   ├── index.ts            # Drizzle client
│   ├── migrate.ts          # Migration runner
│   └── schema/
│       ├── index.ts        # Schema exports
│       └── users.ts        # User auth schema (4 tables)
app/
├── api/
│   └── auth/
│       └── [...all]/route.ts    # Better Auth API routes
└── unauthorized/
    └── page.tsx            # Access denied page
```

**Database Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts with roles, preferences, subscriptions (17 columns)
- `sessions` - Active user sessions (5 columns)
- `accounts` - OAuth provider accounts (7 columns)
- `verification_tokens` - Email verification tokens (3 columns)

**Authentication Utilities:**

**Server-Side (lib/auth/server.ts):**
```typescript
import { requireAuth, requireRole, getSession } from '@/lib/auth/server';

// Require authentication
const session = await requireAuth(); // Redirects to /auth/signin if not authenticated

// Require specific roles
const session = await requireRole(['breeder', 'admin']); // Redirects to /unauthorized if role doesn't match

// Get session (no redirect)
const session = await getSession(); // Returns null if not authenticated
```

**Client-Side (lib/auth/client.ts):**
```typescript
import { useAuth, useRole, useSubscription } from '@/lib/auth/client';

// Main auth hook
const { user, session, isLoading, isAuthenticated, signIn, signOut, signUp } = useAuth();

// Role checking
const { role, isBreeder, isVet, isAdmin, isEventOrganizer } = useRole();

// Subscription status
const { plan, features, isPremium, isProfessional, isEnterprise } = useSubscription();
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://...'                        # Neon PostgreSQL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3002
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=haZG3WQH...                        # Generated securely
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...                                   # Optional: Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...                               # Optional: Google OAuth
```

**Modern Best Practices:**
- ✅ No middleware (server component-level auth for security)
- ✅ Cached session queries (performance optimized)
- ✅ Type-safe with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Production-ready with proper error handling
- ✅ Ready for email verification (disabled for testing)
- ✅ Ready for Google OAuth (disabled until credentials provided)

**Migration Commands:**
```bash
npm run db:generate  # Generate migrations from schema changes
npm run db:migrate   # Apply migrations to database
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes directly (dev only)
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
```

**Role-Based Route Access:**
- **Breeder**: `/dashboard`, `/animals`, `/calculators`, `/tasks`, `/reports`, `/marketplace`, `/frozen-semen`, `/breeders`, `/documents`, `/settings`
- **Veterinarian**: `/dashboard`, `/appointments`, `/records`, `/patients`, `/settings`
- **Admin**: `/dashboard`, `/users`, `/system`, `/analytics`, `/settings`
- **Event Organizer**: `/dashboard`, `/events`, `/registrations`, `/results`, `/settings`

**See `PHASE_1_TASK_1.1_COMPLETE.md` for full implementation details.**

- ✅ Sign Up page with role selection (4 roles)
- ✅ Forgot Password page with email reset
- ✅ Extended user type system
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Beautiful UI maintained

**Updated Files:**
- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Real authentication with authClient.signIn.email()
- `app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - User registration with role selector and validation
- `app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Password reset via API fetch
- `lib/auth/client.ts` - Added ExtendedUser type casting
- `lib/auth/types.ts` - NEW: Extended user interface for custom fields

**Sign Up Features:**
- Role selection dropdown with icons:
  - 🐾 Breeder (default)
  - 🩺 Veterinarian
  - 📅 Event Organizer
  - 👥 Administrator
- Full validation (password min 8 chars, must match, all fields required)
- Terms & conditions checkbox
- Error alerts + toast notifications

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User signs up → selects role → creates account
2. Better Auth creates user with custom role field
3. Redirect to `/dashboard` on success
4. Error handling with specific messages
5. Loading states during async operations

**Type Safety:**
- Created `ExtendedUser` interface for role, subscription, preferences
- Type casting in useAuth, useRole, useSubscription hooks
- All TypeScript errors resolved

**See `PHASE_1_TASK_1.2_COMPLETE.md` for full implementation details.**

---

#### ✅ Task 1.3: Implement Permission System (COMPLETE)
**Implementation Date**: January 2025

**Key Components:**
- ✅ 70+ permissions covering all resources
- ✅ Role-based permission mappings (4 roles)
- ✅ Client-side permission hooks
- ✅ Server-side permission utilities
- ✅ Database schema for future dynamic permissions
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety

**Files Created:**
```
lib/permissions/
├── index.ts              # Main exports + documentation
├── definitions.ts        # 70+ permissions + role mappings
├── hooks.ts              # usePermissions, useResourcePermissions
└── server.ts             # requirePermission, checkPermission

lib/db/schema/
└── permissions.ts        # Future dynamic permissions schema
```

**Permission Coverage:**
- **Breeder**: 42 permissions (full breeder features)
- **Veterinarian**: 13 permissions (appointments, records, shared animals)
- **Admin**: All 70+ permissions (full system access)
- **Event Organizer**: 11 permissions (events + limited viewing)

**Client-Side Usage:**
```typescript
import { usePermissions, PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/permissions';

const { hasPermission, canCreate } = usePermissions();
if (hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.ANIMALS_CREATE)) {
  return <CreateButton />;
}
```

**Server-Side Usage:**
```typescript
import { requirePermission, PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/permissions/server';

await requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.ANIMALS_CREATE);
```

**API Route Protection:**
```typescript
const { allowed } = await checkPermission(PERMISSIONS.ANIMALS_CREATE);
if (!allowed) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
```

**Resource:Action Pattern:**
All permissions follow `resource:action` naming:
- `animals:create`, `animals:read`, `animals:update`, `animals:delete`
- `matings:create`, `calculators:use`, `reports:export`
- `marketplace:list`, `frozen_semen:create`, `tasks:complete`

**See `PHASE_1_TASK_1.3_COMPLETE.md` for full implementation details.**
